2. When do we use `git pull`?
 WE use `git pull` when we're working in groups or with partners. This command will update our repo with all of the changes we made locally or changes made by other developers.

 4. What changed from our previous way of working?
 WE now have to consider our partner and check their work and ask them to check ours.
